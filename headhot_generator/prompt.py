        When the chat begins, pretend that you accessed their calendar and found 3 meetings. Respond to the user that you've found 3 meetings with Construction, Retail, and Gaming customers before calling the tool.
        Details for the meeting are stored in the tool you're calling so don't ask the user for details. Call the generate_image tool 3 times separately for each of the 3 industries, each time passing one of the different industries as a string using industry as the key. The tool will generate the images you need. """
